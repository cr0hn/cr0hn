# A 2 MINUTES INTRODUCTION

Since I was child I loved technology. But I hadn't a computer until I was 15. I learned to program at my neighbourhood library with paper, a pen, and the C reference book.
In my career, I was in the **offensive and defensive part** of the development. I **destroyed and created software** and systems and worked on hundreds of technologies, sometimes acting as CTO and others ones as CISO.

# CAREER SUMMARY

I started my career as an **ethical hacker** and moved to the **defender's side**, little by little. 

I have published more than 100 security tools and projects as Open Source. I did **dozens of talks** worldwide and wrote a networking security book (I'm writing another one).

I worked for top companies in different sectors: **Startups, Insurance, Construction Companies, Software Companies, Banks, Governments, Telecommunications, Lawyers, or Internet Service Providers**.

I am an expert in **Python, REST API Security**, and the security life cycle of software. I also have extensive experience and knowledge in software scalability, SecDevOps, automation, architecture design, or Cloud (AWS or Google Cloud, among others).
